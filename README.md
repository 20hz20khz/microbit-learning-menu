# Microbit Learning Menu

The goal of this project was to allow students to demonstrate their computer science knowledge while exploring various aspects of the BBC Microbit. In addition to the device itself, we also used alligator clips, speakers, LEDs, NeoPixels, standard 9-gram servos, continuous rotation servos, cardboard, and tin foil.

## Simulation Preparation

A few days prior to actually working with the device, students researched the Microbit and it's built-in sensors. They went to microbit.org and started using the block-based editor (and the Javascript editor) and previewing their result with the simulated Microbit. For simple starter activities, students displayed "Hello World" on the matrix, created a countdown time, and created a simple counting app in which A button increase the count and B button decreased the count.

## Microbit 1: Countdown Game (required)
Create a timer variable and set it to 5 (or 9).

Create a score variable (or two) and set it to 0.

Countdown from 5 to 0, displaying the timer on the "screen"

When the timer is zero or less, say who wins... either player A or player B.

Upload your HEX file here when finished.

## Microbit 2: Bouncing Of The Walls (required)
Create a variable and set it to be a sprite at x 2, y 2

The sprite automatically moves forward and bounces off the walls at random angles.

A and B buttons MUST do something, but you get to decide what the A and B buttons do. Ideas:

-	A starts/resumes the animation and B pauses the animation
-	A increases the speed and B decreases the speed.
-	When A and B are pressed at the same time, the sprite moves back to the center.
